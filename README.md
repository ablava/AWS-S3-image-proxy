This repo provides a proof of concept solution for uploading images (e.g. stored from a webcam) into a private AWS S3 bucket and serving them over HTTPS using image re-sizing proxy based on nginx server with image filter and ngx_aws_auth modules. Please read the comments in the scripts to get started.
